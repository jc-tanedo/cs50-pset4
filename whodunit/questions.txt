1.    What’s stdint.h?
        Contains definition for new integer types.
2.    What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
        To match the size of variables in BMP header?
3.    How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
        8, 32, 32, 16
4.    What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
        BM
5.    What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
        bfSize is the size (in bytes) of the file. biSize is the size of the structure
6.    What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
        negative biHeight means a top-down image (origin pixel on upper left)
7.    What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
        biBitCount
8.    Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
        no access or file not found
9.    Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
        the code always accesses one byte at a time
10.   What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
        3
11.   What does fseek do?
        changes current address in file that is being accessed
12.   What is SEEK_CUR?
        the current address of file accessed
